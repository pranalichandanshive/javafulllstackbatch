-- a process of wrapping code & data into single unit
Ex. Capsule

class Student{

   private int rollNo;// data members

}
Advantage:
1. make the data members read only or write only.(set and get method use)
2. control over the data
3. achieve data hiding

Homework :
1. Employee
        int id
        String name
        double salary //write only
        double bonus  //read only
        String email
   Create double calculateBonus() - salary + bonus

  ******* Advantage of Encapsulation in Java************

   -By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only.
    In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.

    -It provides you the control over the data.
     Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only,
      you can write the logic inside the setter method.
      You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.

     - It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java
      because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.

      -The encapsulate class is easy to test. So, it is better for unit testing.

     - The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters.
      So, it is easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in Java.
